# Netflix-Automatic-Skip-Intro
I made a simple automatic skip intro extension using GPT. I was sick of not wanting to keep clicking skip intro while watching short episodes like The Office. GPT helped me create this simple code that does the trick. I haven't uploaded to the extensions store as it requires a developer account. This requires you to be in developer mode to load. 

Steps to Install:
1. Create a folder locally on your PC, and put the content.js and manifest.json into that folder. 
2. Navigate to your Extensions page for Google Chrome. 
3. Activate Developer Mode.
4. Click Load Unpacked. 
5. Navigate to the folder you created which has the content and manifest files and select that folder. (You won't see any files when doing this, it will look empty but select that folder anyway)
6. You should now see the extension has been added. Activate the extension. 

Like I said this is very simple code that does a simple job. I'm not a developer so someone could probably make something way more effective, but for anyone with low experience like me, this will be perfect for you. I've tested this for over a week and found it works great, unlike those chrome extensions that claim to do the same thing. 

If you experience any errors please let me know. Just thought I'd share this so everyone could benefit.
